# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

This assignment will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset stored at (StarterCode/static/js/data.js). Users can filter the table data for specific values. Only pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js were used on web pages. 

## Description

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (UFO-level-1 folder)

* Created a basic HTML web page 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, code was written that appends a table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * There is a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` 

* Used a date form in your HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (UFO-level-2)

* Used multiple `input` tags , wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
